This Project is a one step forward the web-app i made.

In this I am trying to maintain a session when the user logs in the account.

This is an e-commerce website and there are items on it. The items can be only bought if user has made the account. 

So, an option is available to user to create and account and then they can login to buy the items they are looking for.

This project uses session managment,jsp,buy buttons, mysql server.
